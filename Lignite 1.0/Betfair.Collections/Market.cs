         * While the Synchronized wrappers may improve performance by virtue of the fact that they 
         * contain internal knowledge of the container’s implementation, they can only guarantee the 
         * atomicity of individual methods. Therefore, if a reader thread iterates over a container 
         * while a writer thread adds or removes items from it, the container’s content is changing 
         * during the reader’s iteration. This can cause confusion and could be undesirable because 
         * it might show a non-stable view of the object. If we really want groups of operations to 
         * be taken atomically, then we are back at our first solution: placing those operations 
         * within a monitor’s protection. However, instead of directly locking the container, 
         * lock the SyncRoot property of the container, which gives the proper behavior regardless 
         * of what you pass to it: an unsynchronized container instance or a wrapped instance 
         * obtained by using the Synchronized static method. What we are trying to avoid here is to 
         * have double synchronization which could hurt performance unnecessarily; this could happen 
         * if we are using a synchronized wrapper for those places where method atomicity is sufficient, 
         * but would like to use a monitor for making sets of operations atomic. The SyncRoot 
         * property is able to do this because it will always return the raw container object.
